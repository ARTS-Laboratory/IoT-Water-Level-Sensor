# Arduino Code

### Sensor Code

The INO file is the Arduino code which can be uploaded to an Arduino Mega. Remember to include
the Adafruit user name and AIO key so that it will connect to the right server.

The libraries used with the Wifi sensor package are standard and can be downloaded unto your computer using the 
Arduino software

### Auxillary Code

This contains two helpful Arduino codes, one to the set the time on an RTC in order to calibrate it. 
The other is a demo code which can also be found in the Wifi101 folder in the Examples tab in the Arduino software
after the Wifi101 library has been installed. This will help to troubleshoot connectivity issues.
