IoT Water Level Sensor


This is a stage sensor developed by the ARTS-Lab at the University of South Carolina and interns at the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC) Dam Safety Program. The purpose of this sensor is to provide a low-cost, open-source alternative to traditional gaging equipment.
